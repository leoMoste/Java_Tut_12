          only a single object is created from one "when we use this"
	      The object may have “extras” or "changes"
	      and no need to create a " Separate inner class "
	      ** when it only need it once.
	      Helps us to avoid cluttering code with a class name
	
	      Syntax is similar to a constructor,
	      except that there is also a class definition
	      within a block of code.  
	      GREAT FOR LISTENERS
